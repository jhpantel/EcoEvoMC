Installation: Use of this code requires MATLAB and access to the files eeed.m, Kx.m, XXX, and YYY.

Usage: Download the files eeed.m, Kx.m, XXX, and YYY. Place all in the same directory. The file eeed.m is the main simulation file, so executing that will run all 27 simulation conditions described in the manuscript Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks and the Maintenance of Metacommunity Diversity in a Changing Environment. Caution that all 27 simulation conditions are set to run in a loop, so the execution of code may take some time. The code produces a set of 27 results (.mat) files that will be saved to the same directory as the code. The function in the file Kx.m is called during the course of eeed.m.
